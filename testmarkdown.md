(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and requires medical attention. 
Most people infected with the virus will experience *mild to moderate* respiratory illness 
without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like **cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer** are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

## How did the coronavirus start?

`The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus
later named `SARS-CoV-2.` SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so   
it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease  outbreaks have been 
traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become 
dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus 
evolved to cause pandemic disease.`

### What is the incubation period for COVID-19?

> Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to
